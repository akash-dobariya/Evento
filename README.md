# EVENTO — Event × Volunteer Management

**Accountability-first. Transparent. Trusted.**

Evento is a platform designed to connect volunteers with event organizers through transparent, verified workflows. It addresses the fragmentation in the event-volunteer sector by replacing unorganized coordination with a rule-driven digital platform.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The event-volunteer sector suffers from informal coordination, leading to no-shows, payment disputes, and a lack of accountability. **EVENTO** solves this by centralizing applications and verifying users to ensure:

*   **Verified Payment Guards:** Preventing fraud and delayed payments.
*   **Two-Way Accountability:** Ensuring both organizers and volunteers honor their commitments.
*   **Centralized Dispute Resolution:** A formal process for handling disagreements.
*   **Review-Based Trust:** Building a professional reputation system.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project is built with a lightweight, modern stack ensuring fast load times and easy maintenance:

*   **HTML5:** Semantic markup.
*   **Tailwind CSS (CDN):** Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
*   **CSS3:** Custom properties (variables) for theming and animations.
*   **JavaScript (Vanilla):** Lightweight interactivity.
*   **Lucide Icons:** Beautiful, consistent open-source icons.

## 📂 Project Structure

The project has been modularized for better maintainability:
